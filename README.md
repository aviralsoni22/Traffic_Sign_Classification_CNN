# Traffic_Sign_Classification_CNN
Description: This project focuses on the classification of Traffic Signs using deep learning technique: CNN.

**Details:** In this project, our primary objective is to develop highly accurate models for the classification of traffic signs on the road using the TensorFlow and Keras libraries.
The overarching goal of this project is to provide valuable insights into traffic sign classification. The potential applications of such a model are diverse and impactful,
especially in the context of autonomous vehicles. By integrating our model into these vehicles, we can enhance driver safety by alerting them to traffic signs, potentially saving them from penalties,
and improving overall road safety.
Note:
This model runs best in Google Colaboratory.
This file contains the .h5 file of the model which can be directly loaded by the user to save the runtime and predict the results.
The Repository contains 3 .png images which the user can use to crosscheck the working of the model.
